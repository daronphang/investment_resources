## Bankruptcy Filing:
- Businesses use bankruptcy court for reorganizing purposes which involve overhauling the business to make it profitable and getting creditors to agree to more generous payment terms.
- When filing for bankruptcy, past debts don't have to be paid while case is ongoing; however, deadlines are imposed to prevent companies from ducking creditors too long while in bankruptcy.
- Benefits of new law under Small Business Reorganization Act (less than $2.7 million in debt).
- Allows business owners to keep their equity, so long they distribute their disposable income to creditors over next 3-5 years (previously had no stake in reorganized enterprise unless all debts are repaid in full).
- Reorganization plan is confirmed by judge and not by creditors that will typically object under SubchapterV.
- Bankruptcy costs are cheaper (normally expensive due to high court and attorney costs).
