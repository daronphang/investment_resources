## Value-Added Tax (VAT):
- A consumption tax placed on a product whenever value is added at each stage of supply chain from production to sale.
- In contrast, sales tax is applied to the end of the chain.
- Amount of VAT is based on taxpayers' consumption rather than income; VAT applies equally to every purchase in constrast to progressive income tax which levies greater taxes on wealthy. 
- VAT is most commonly found in EU.

### Advocates vs Critics:
- Advocates say it raises government revenues without punishing success/wealth as income taxes do, and is simplier and more standardized than a traditional sales tax with fewer compliance issues (closing tax loopholes).
- Critics charge that VAT is essentially a regressive tax that places an increased economic strain on lower-income taxpayers and adds bureaucratic burdens for businesses throughout the chain of production.

### Example:
Dulce candy sold in Alexia with 10% VAT:
1) Supplier sells raw materials to manufacturer for $2 plus VAT of $0.20 (total $2.20) and renders $0.20 to Alexia.
2) Manufacturer sells to retailer for $5 plus VAT of $0.50 (total $5.50) and manufacturer renders $0.30 to Alexia.
3) Retailer sells to consumers for $10 plus VAT of $1.00 (total $11.00) and retailer renders $0.50 to Alexia.
4) Total VAT paid to government is $1.00 split among supplier, manufacturer and retailer.
