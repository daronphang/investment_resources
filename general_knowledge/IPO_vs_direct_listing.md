## IPO:
- Firms use services of intermediaries (underwriters) who facilitate IPO process and charge commission.
- Underwriters help to issue new shares, work with company in deciding initial offering price, and selling to investors via their distribution networks comprising of investment banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds and insurance companies.

## IPO vs Direct Listing:
- Both methods are used to raise interest-free capital by listing shares on public exchange.
- Major differences are that direct listing sells existing stocks and does not involve underwriters while IPO issue new shares through underwriting.
