## IPO:
- Firms use services of intermediaries (underwriters) who facilitate IPO process and charge commission.
- Underwriters help to issue new shares, work with company in deciding initial offering price, and selling to investors via their distribution networks comprising of investment banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds and insurance companies.
- Also provide guarantee of sale for specified number of stocks and may purchase anything in excess.

## Direct Listing:
- Companies that can't afford underwriting, don't want share dilution (no new issued shares) or are avoiding lockup periods often choose direct listing process.
- However, without an underwriter, there is no support or guarantee of sale, no safe long-term investors, and no defense by large shareholders against volatility in share price.
- Availability of stock depends on current employees/investors; if no one wants to sell their shares on day of listing, no transactions will occur and stock price is purely dependent on market demand.
- Direct listing is not focused on raising additional capital for expansion/funding but rather to increase liquidity for existing shareholders.

## IPO vs Direct Listing:
- Both methods are used to raise interest-free capital by listing shares on public exchange.
- Major differences are that direct listing sells existing stocks and does not involve underwriters while IPO issue new shares through underwriting.
