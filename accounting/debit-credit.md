### Debit vs Credit

- Debit (DR) is an accounting entry that either increases asset/expense account and decreases liability/equity account i.e. records money flowing into an account.
- Credit (CR) is an accounting entry that decreases an asset/expense account and increase liability/equity account i.e. records money flowing out of an account.
- Most businesses use double-entry accounting whereby every debit (inflow) always has a corresponding credit (outflow).

Reversal of the use of debits and credits for asset and liability accounts stems from accounting equation:

```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

### Account Rules

- Asset: Debit increases balance and credit decreases balance.
- Liability: Debit decreases balance and credit increases balance.
- Equity: Debit decreases balance and credit increases balance.
- Revenue: Debit decreases balance and credit increases balance.
- Expense: Debit increases balance and credit decreases balance.
- Cash: Debit increases balance and credit decreases balance.
