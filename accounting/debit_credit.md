## Debit vs Credit:
- Debit (dr) is an accounting entry that either increases asset/expense account and decreases liability/equity account i.e. records money flowing into an account.
- Credit (cr) is an accounting entry that decreases an asset/expense account and increase liability/equity account i.e. records money flowing out of an account.
- Most businesses use double-entry accounting whereby every debit (inflow) always has a corresponding credit (outflow).
