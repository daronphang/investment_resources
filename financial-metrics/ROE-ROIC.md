## NOPAT

NOPAT represents company's theoretical income from operations if it had no debt (no interest expense) and ignores tax advantages. Taxes deferred or used as benefit can distort earnings and cash flow. Difference EBIT as it excludes non-operating income and expenses.

```
NOPAT = operating income * (1 - tax rate)
```

## Return on Equity (ROE)

Measures how effectively a firm can use money from shareholders to generate profits and grow the company.

```
ROE = net income / shareholder's equity
```

## Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

Invested capital is investment made by shareholders and debtholders in a company through stock/bond issuance. Source of funding that enables company to engage new opportunities such as expansion, shares buyback, dividend payments, payoff debt. Can be calculated using operating\* or financing approach. Companies choose invested capital over bank loans as follows:

- No obligation to issue dividends and makes it a cheap source of capital as compared to paying interest on bank loan
- Bank loans have stricter criteria for lending

When calculating ROIC, practical matters to consider are:

- Excess cash
- Goodwill (acquisition and impairment)
- Restructuring charges
- Operating leases
- Minority interests
- R&D
- Dividends (should not deduct from NOPAT)
- Share buybacks (won't affect if excess cash is excluded)

```
operating approach (preferred): IC = net non-cash working capital + PPE + goodwill & intangibles + other operating assets

financing approach: IC = total debt + leases + total equity + non-operating cash & investments*
*cash flow from financing and investing activities

ROIC = net operating profit after tax / invested capital
```
