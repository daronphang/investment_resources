## 2008 Financial Crisis:
- Decision by FMFM to expand subprime mortgage market in 1 999 was the catalyst that fueled over-demand in real-estate.
- Subprime mortgages target borrowers with less-than-perfect credit and adequate savings. 
- Effort was to make home loans more accessible to those with lower credit.
- Adjustable-rate mortgages were the most lethal as borrowers would make much lower initial payments than fixed-rate mortgages. 
- Virtually risk-free and borrowers could end up with positive equity as their homes would increase in value; if they could not afford mortgage payments, they would sell homes for profit.
