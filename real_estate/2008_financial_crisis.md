## 2008 Financial Crisis:
- Decision by FMFM to expand subprime mortgage market in 1 999 was the catalyst that fueled over-demand in real-estate.
- Subprime mortgages target borrowers with less-than-perfect credit and adequate savings. 
- Effort was to make home loans more accessible to those with lower credit.
- Adjustable-rate mortgages were the most lethal as borrowers would make much lower initial payments than fixed-rate mortgages. 
- Virtually risk-free and borrowers could end up with positive equity as their homes would increase in value; if they could not afford mortgage payments, they would sell homes for profit.
- Rapid increase in home prices and growing demand for MBS encouraged banks to lower their lending standards and drive consumers to jump into the market at any cost.
- Quality of MBS declined and ratings became meaningless. 
- Risks flowed to investors whereas middlemen including investment banks and mortgage lenders take a cut of money along the way. 
- Home loans became so divided and spread across the financial spectrum that it was posible of a given homeowner to own shares in his mortgage.
- US Treasury stepped in with $700 billion financial system bailout intended to ease credit crunch; Federal Reserve bought $4.5 trillion in MBS over a period of years. 

Big banks survived crisis as they bought credit default swaps on the same CDOs they were selling; however, banks that owed big banks couldn't repay their debts and hence, US government had to bailout. Banks that sold insurance had significantly lesser money to cover bets if housing market failed.

## Factors Leading to Bubble:
1) Widespread subprime lending with relaxed lending standards including extremely low down-payment requirements.
2) Low Federal Reserve interest rates which helped fund risky investments via easy credit.
3) When rates were raised between 2004-2006, resulted in massive defaults on mortgages as homes were worth less than debts and lessened demand.
4) Rise of high-yielding MBS which made more mortgage credit available to borrowers and encouraged them to take excessive risks.
5) Short-term relationship between mortgage broker and borrower helped fuel demand. 

## Credit Default Swaps:
- A financial derivative/insurance contract that allows an investor to swap or offset his credit risk with that of another investor.
- in CDS, one party "sells" risk and counterparty "buys" or assumes that risk; seller pays periodic fee to buyer and in return, buyer agrees to pay a set amount when default occurs.
- CDS are designed to cover many risks including defaults and credit rating downgrades. 
- CDS contracts are maintained via ongoing premium payment.
- Primarily used to hedge risk and speculation.
- Most common form of credit derivative involves municipal bonds, emerging market bonds, MBS, and corporate bonds on over-the-counter markets.
