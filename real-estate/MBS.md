## Mortgage-Backed Securities

- Debt instrument/loan secured by the collateral of specified real estate properties i.e. an investment made up of bundle of home loans bought from banks that issued them; investors receive periodic payments similar to bond coupon payments
- Collateral is an item of value used to secure a loan; helps to minimize risk for lenders
- Individuals/businesses use mortgages to make large real estate purchases without paying the entire price upfront
- Traded on secondary market that enables investors to profit from mortgage business without the need to directly buy/sell home loans
- When investors buy MBS, is essentially lending money to home buyers and gets rights to value of mortgage and interest payments

## How MBS Works

MBS turns the bank into a middleman between homebuyer and investment industry:

1. Banks grant mortgages to its customers and then sell them at a discount to investment banks/government institutions
2. Mortgages are packaed together into MBS and securities are issued to investors as tranches
3. Tranches can be further repackaged and sold again as other securities known as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
4. Recorded as a sale on Balance Sheet and loses nothing if homebuyer defaults as risk is transferred to investors
5. Works well if banks keep to reasonable standards for granting mortgages, homebuyers keep payments on time, and credit rating agencies that review MBS perform their due dillgence
