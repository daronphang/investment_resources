## Bank Deposits vs Loans:
Deposit is a liability for banks as depositors are paid interest or is payable on demand (during withdrawal) whereas loans are assets as banks earn interest income from them.

## Capital/Financial Leverage:
The use of borrowed capital as a funding source when investing to expand firm's asset base and generate returns on risk capital. Strategy used to increase potential returns on an investment. Higher leverage means more debt.

## Debt Rollover:
Rolling over a loan means to extend the loan's due date by paying additional fee i.e. replacing existing loan with new loan. Potentially trapped in cycle debt. 

## Extinguishment of Debt:
Removing a liability from Balance Sheet when bonds reach their maturity and holders are paid face value of security.
