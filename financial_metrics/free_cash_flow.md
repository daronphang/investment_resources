## Free Cash Flow:
Represents the cash a company generates to repay creditors, pay dividends, or perform business expansion after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. Sharp declines in FCF due to purchase of PPE is expected; will be recuperated as its expense will be spread out over time via depreciation.

## Levered Free Cash Flow:
Cash flow available after firm has met its financial obligations.

## Unlevered Free Cash Flow:
Cash flow available to all equitholders and debtholders before paying financial obligations i.e. excludes interest expense and debt repayments. Preferred when building DCF as follows:
- Used to determine the enterprise value of firm.
- Has highest correlation of firm's economic value on its own without leverage.
- Ignores capital structure which makes firms comparable and discretionary. 

## Formulas:
```
FCF = cash from operating activities - CAPEX (from investing activities)
FCF = net income + non-cash expenses - changes in NWC - CAPEX

UFCF = NOPAT + D&A - CAPEX - changes in NWC
```
