## Working Capital (NWC):
Difference between current assets and liabilities. It is a measure of company's liqudity, operational efficiency and short-term financial health. 

### Interpretation:
- Positive NWC indicates the company has potential to invest and grow.
- However, indicate the business has too much inventory or not investing its excess cash.
- Negative NWC may indicate the business has trouble growing or paying back its creditors i.e. risk of default.

### How to Change NWC:
- Tightening credit/collection policy which reduces accounts receivable and frees up cash but may decline net sales.
- Increasing inventory during planning will increase inventory investment and uses cash. 
- Negotiating with creditors/suppliers for longer payment periods though interests may be higher.
- Higher growth rate requires more investment in assets and having more accounts receivable and inventory which uses cash.

### Changes in Operating Working Capital (Non-Cash):
Change in working capital is the difference between net working capital amount from one accounting period to the next. Companies will try to shorten working capital cycle to improve cash flow. This can be obtained from the operating cash flow statement. More importantly is to understand how the working capital changes i.e. if current assets increase, operating working capital increases but company needs to spend more cash for operations. Excludes cash and investments in marketable securities.

- If final value for change in working capital in negative, change in current operating assets has increased higher than current operating liabilities; company needs more capital to grow and working capital increases. 
- If final value for change in working capital is positive, the company can grow with less cash as it is delaying payments or getting money upfront and hence, working capital decreases.

### Formulas:
``` 
NWC = current assets - current liabilities
Non-cash WC = current assets - cash - marketable securities - current liabilities
```
