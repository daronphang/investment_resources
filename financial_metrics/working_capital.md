## Working Capital (NWC):
Difference between current assets and liabilities. A measure of company's liqudity, operational efficiency and short-term financial health. 

### Interpretation:
- Positive NWC indicates the company has potential to invest and grow.
- However, indicate the business has too much inventory or not investing its excess cash.
- Negative NWC may indicate the business has trouble growing or paying back its creditors i.e. risk of default.
- If the current assets and current liabilities have increased by the same amount, there would be no change in net working capital.

### Actions that Change NWC:
- Tightening credit/collection policy which reduces accounts receivable and frees up cash but may decline net sales.
- Increasing inventory during planning will increase inventory investment and uses cash. 
- Changing purchasing practices to bulk volumes will increase investment in inventory and uses cash.
- Negotiating with creditors/suppliers for longer payment periods though interests may be higher.
- Higher growth rate requires more investment in assets and having more accounts receivable and inventory which uses cash.

### Changes in Operating Working Capital (Non-Cash):
Change in working capital is the difference between net working capital amount from one accounting period to the next. **This provides a better understanding on the company's cash position.** Companies will try to shorten working capital cycle to improve cash flow and hence, minimizing the need to acquire additional funding. This can be obtained from the operating cash flow statement. More importantly is to understand how the working capital changes i.e. if current assets increase, company has spent money to purchase additional assets resulting in cash outflow. Excludes cash and investments in marketable securities.

When performing DCF, should think about how the cash flow requirements of the business affects final owner's earnings calculation.

- If final value for change in working capital is negative, change in current operating assets has increased higher than current operating liabilities; company needs more capital to grow, working capital increases (cash outflow) and **SHOULD reduce owner's earnings.** 
- If final value for change in working capital is positive, the company can grow with less cash as it is delaying payments (i.e. accounts payable, income taxes payable) or getting money upfront (i.e. deferred revenue), working capital decreases (cash inflow) and **SHOULD be added to owner's earnings.**

### Formulas:
``` 
NWC = current assets - current liabilities
Non-cash WC = current assets (less cash and marketable securities) - current liabilities (less debt)

Change in NWC = net working capital (previous year) - net working capital (current year)

Owner's earnings = net income + D&A - CAPEX + change in operating WC
```
