## Reasons for Share Buyback:
1) If there are no potential growth opportunities, holding onto cash means sharing ownership for no good reason and hence, costly.
2) For companies that pay dividends, share buyback can be used to reduce overall cost of capital.
3) Preserves stock price during recession.
4) Stock is undervalued; company can repurchasing at reduced price and re-issue once market has corrected and thereby increasing its equity capital without issuing additional shares.
5) Increases ROA (assets are reduced as cash is used) and ROE (lower equity) and improves EPS (reduces dilution).
6) Company is financially healthy and doesn't require excess equity funding; confidence to reinvest in itself.

## Caveats:
Issuing of stock options or ESPP which are exercised by managers/directors will increase shares outstanding and reduce EPS; company might be compelled to buyback to counteract stock dilution.
