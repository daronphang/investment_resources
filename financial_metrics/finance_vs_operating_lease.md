## Finance/Capital Lease:
A contract entitling a lessee/renter to temporary use of an asset and has economic characteristics of asset ownership for accounting purposes. Finance lease is considered a purchase of an asset and is recorded in balance sheet. Organizations choose to lease long-term assets rather than buying them as it can be used to claim depreciation and interest expense which reduce taxable income. 

To be classified as capital lease under U.S. GAAP, any of four conditions must be met:
1) Transfer of ownership of asset from lessor/owner to lessee at end of term.
2) Option to purchase asset at discounted price at end of term.
3) Term of lease is greater than or equal to 75% of useful life of asset.
4) Present value of lease payments is greater than or equal to 90% of asset's fair market value. 

## Operating Lease:
A contract that allows for use of an asset but does not convey any ownership rights of the asset. Practice of keeping operating leases off balance sheet was changed when Accounting Standards Update came into effect on Dec. 15, 2018 where they are recorded as right-of-use assets and liabilities. Used to provide greater flexibility as equipment can be replaced. No risk of obsolescence and lease payments are still tax-deductible. 

## Finance vs Operating Lease:
- Finance lease depreciates over time and incur principal and interest expense.
- Operating lease is used for short-term leasing of assets and incur lease as operating expenses.
