## Deflation:
Deflation is associated with decreases in pricing of spending. Technology deflates economy in following ways:
- Lower demand for an existing product leading to lower prices.
- Newer efficiencies lead to higher supply.

During deflation, customers expect decreasing prices; more inclined to engage in profit maximization and thereby spending less. An innovation that is disruptive allows a whole new population of consumers access to a product/service that has historically been only accessible to consumers with money and skill.

Deflation driven by technology appears to be "benign" as it is caused by an increase in output and excess supply resulting from innovations that increase efficiency and reduce cost of goods. "Malign" deflation is caused by deficient demand which reduces consumption, output and falling wages. Major innovations with deflationary effects include:
1) DNA sequencing.
2) Energy storage.
3) AI/3D printing.
4) Blockchain-technology.
5) Robotics.
