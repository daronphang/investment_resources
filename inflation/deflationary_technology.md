## Deflation:
Deflation is associated with decreases in pricing of spending. Technology deflates economy in following ways:
- Lower demand for an existing product leading to lower prices.
- Newer efficiencies lead to higher supply.

During deflation, customers expect decreasing prices; more inclined to engage in profit maximization and thereby spending less. An innovation that is disruptive allows a whole new population of consumers access to a product/service that has historically been only accessible to consumers with money and skill.
