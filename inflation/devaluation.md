## Devaluation:
Monetary policy tool to deliberately adjust downwards the value of a country's money relative to another currency or group of currencies.

### Reasons for Devaluating:
- Combat trade imbalance as it reduces cost of country's exports and renders them more competitive in global markets which could also lead to job creation in export sectors.
- Increases cost of imports so consumers are less likely to purchase foreign goods and further strengthens domestic businesses as consumers opt for local alternatives.
- Spurs economic growth as exports increase and imports decrease, and favors a better balance of payments by shrinking trade deficits.
- Soverign debt burdens are reduced as a weaker currency makes interest payments less expensive over time.
- Higher costs of imports will lead to higher prices of goods/services due to lesser supply and hence, cause inflation to rise.

### Negative Impacts:
- Higher demand for exported goods will lead to price increases which may normalize initial effect of devaluation.
- Other countries will be incentivized to devalue their currencies and may lead to trade war.
- Reduces real wages with employees demanding higher wages.
- More expensive imports and decreasing purchasing power will cause consumers to spend more leading to inflation.
- More expensive for domestic consumers to travel (tourism sectors in other countries impacted).
- Rapid devaluation may scare off international investors as they are less likely to hold government bonds.
- Increased debt burden on consumers with debt in foreign currency.
