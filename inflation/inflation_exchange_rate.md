## How Inflation AFfects Exchange Rate Between Two Nations:
- Inflation impacts time value of money that it decreases the value of dollar over time.
- Higher inflation across major economies would cause a spike in exchange rate volatility and depreciate currencies in nominal terms relative to currencies of countries with subdued inflation; exports for other countries would be more expensive and slow economic growth.
- Ultimate determination of value and exchange rate of nation's currency is perceived desirability of holding that currency.
- Influenced by factors including government stability and ecnonomy. 
- High possibility of sudden devaluation would cause investors to shy away from that currency.

### Carry Trades:
Combination of borrowing in nations where interest rates are low and investing in those where yields are higher i.e. borrowing greenback and investing in developing-nation currencies. Works in low volatility environment. Higher interest rates in borrowing countries would have negative impact on investors; this would require emerging-market central banks to raise interest rates fast enough to ensure sufficient yield premium to improve carry returns.
