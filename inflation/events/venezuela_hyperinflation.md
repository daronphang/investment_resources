## Venezuela:
- Once the richest country in Latin America with largest oil reserves in the world, its economy is in shambles with political and currency instability growing rampant across the country. 
- GDP depended solely on oil exports (accounting for 90% of export earnings) which made its economy susceptible to oil price fluctuations.
- President Hugo Chavez's key movement happened in 2004 when oil prices surgedl spent billions from profits on social-welfare programs to combat poverty and social inequality by making food, healthcare and education affordable. 
- However, did not scale back on Venezuela's dependence on oil, diversified its economy and hence, his program was not sustainable if oil prices fell.
- Combined with his unrestrained spending led to a growing national deficit.
- When his successor Maduro took office in 2014, oil prices crashed.
- Resulting actions did not account for hyperinflation (highest in the world at 10,000,000% as of 2018).

## Causes of Hyperinflation:
1) Devaluation of Bolivar due to weaker foreign demand for Venezuelan oil and higher costs of imported goods.
2) Increased money supply to fund excessive government spending and combat devaluation in short-term; however, oil prices continued to fall which drove Bolivar value even lower.
3) Citizens converting cash savings into foreign currency whereby the government responded by issuing currency controls; nonetheless trade was still available on black market.
4) Lack of confidence and lost of faith in currency among locals drove demand for US dollar even higher; further weakened Bolivar and pushed inflation higher.
5) Further devaluation of Bolivar by 99.6% in 2018 with redominating and tying to new currency (soverign Bolivar) to oil price; however, this achieved opposite effect of economic stimulation as there was little domestic capacity to manufacture goods (mostly imported).
6) Higher demand for foreign goods drove import costs and inflation higher.
