### Zimbabwe Hyperinflation

Started in 1990s when president Robert Mugabe instituted land reforms intended to redistribute land from white landowners to black farmers to correct the injustices of colonialism. However, this started off a chain reaction in negative feedback loop:

1. Many black farmers had no experience which caused agricultural output to plummet by 50% and food supply to be decimated.
2. Prices of food began to rise which led to inflation.
3. Government printed more money to provide subsidies to the poor which fueled higher inflation.
4. USA, EU, and IMF imposed sanctions upon Zimbabwe for snatching lands away from whites, causing citizens working abroad to lose their jobs and roll back on their foreign investments; this resulted in higher unemployment and government again printed more money to support unemployed.
5. Inexperienced farmers began to default on bank loans leading to a callpse in banking sector; government intervened to rescue banks resulting in more inflation.
6. Instability in commodity prices led to locals losing faith in currency which caused them to go on buying spree; massive demand led to higher prices and inflation.
7. Employees stopped going to work as their annual salary was not able to afford a bus ride home leading to economic collapse; government intervened with more money supply and led to higher inflation.

By 2008, inflation hit at 50,000,0000,000%. By Apr 2009, currency ceased to exist and transactions were legaized in foreign currencies. Nonetheless, as mobile penetration was at 80% in Africa, entrepreneurs piggybacked on existing telecom infrastructure to foster nationwide adoption of mobile payments making their economy virtually cashless. Was easy to achieve as people would rather send a text than taking 2-day bus ride to send money.

### Negative Loop

1. Higher prices initially caused by decrease in agricultural output.
2. Government prints more money.
3. Currency devaluation.
4. People spend more leading to higher demand.
