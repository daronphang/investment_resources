## Correlation of Stocks with Inflation:
- Inflation is a process that occurs when prices of goods/services increase over an extended period of time and causing purchasing value of a currency to be lowered.
- As purchasing power decreases, spending is encouraged i.e. buy now then later as money will lose its value.
- Helps to drive up prices of commodities including gold, oil, agricultural goods and hence, serving as a hedge against inflation.
- Instead of hoarding cash, people become desperate to offload currency.
- Most damage prone to rising inflation is fixed-income securities if interest rate is lower than inflation.
- Threat of escalating inflation will result in Federal Reserve raising interest rates to increase cost of borrowing and attract consumers to park their cash in fixed-income instruments to siphon off excess liquidity in the system. 

## Effects of Higher Interest Rates for Stock Market (Bearish in Short-Term):
- Significant effect on consumer and business psychology.
- Creates higher tax on capital gains that makes corporate investment unwise. 
- Minimum return is expected to be higher which pushes market valuation lower to obtain lower P/E.
- Tighter lending standards would mean both businesses and consumers will cut back on spending (lesser disposable income for consumers and more expensive for businesses to invest/expand) which causes revenue and earnings to fall.
- Future cash flows must be discounted with a higher rate which causes valuations to fall.

Need to take into account that higher rates are generally accompanied with faster economic and earnings growth i.e. sectors such as banks, semiconductors and industrials tend to outperform. Additionally, need to consider the level of interest rates at which they are rising from. 

Nonetheless, investing in stocks can be a good hedge against inflation in long-term:
- Companies can raise prices to account for rising costs of sales/wages.
- Results in higher revenue and earnings leading to higher valuation.
