### Causes of Inflation

- Demand-pull: demand for certain goods/services is greater than economy's ability to meet them.
- Cost-push: when cost of wages and materials goes up and passed down to consumers.
- Stronger economic growth: leads to higher consumer spending.
- Increased money supply: too many dollars chasing too few products.
- Devaluation: downward adjustment in country's exchange rate makes exports less expensive and encourages purchasing of domestic products over foreign imports.

Higher costs may not necessary translate to inflationary pressures (transitory than actual) if demand is not strong enough to sustain it.

### Effects of Inflation

- Negative real interest rates on fixed-income securities (inflation rate > interest rates).
- Higher costs of borrowing through Federal Reserve intervention.
- Wage inflation.
- Export prices become less competitive.
- Lower confidence to invest.
- Real debt levels fall i.e. debtors will gain as they repay their debts in currency that has lower value.
- Dilutes savings for hard-income earners and widens wealth inequality.
