## Yield Curve

- Yield curve plots interest rates of bonds of equal credit and different maturities
- Provides an indication of where short-term interest rates and economic growth are headed into the future
- Three types include normal, inverted and flat
- Normal curves point to economic expansion, inverted points to economic recession

## Yield Curve Risk

- Risk that a change in interest rates will impact fixed-income securities and is associated with flattening/steepening of curve
- Flattening is defined as narrowing of yield spread between short-term and long-term rates (interest rates converging)
- Steepening refers to widening of spread i.e. yields on long-term bonds rising faster than short-term bonds

## Yield Curve Control (YCC)

- Besides QE and adjusting Federal Funds Rate, another policy alternative central banks can implement is YCC (interest-rate caps)
- YCC involves targeting longer-term interest rate by buying or selling bonds as necessary to hit that rate target
- Keeping longer-rates down may be needed for economic stimulus if bringing short-term rates near zero isn't enough
- As Federal Reserve buys bonds, prices of bond increases due to higher demand which keeps rates down
- Lower rates would feed through to lower interest rates on mortgages, car loans, corporate debt and higher stock prices to encourage spending and investment
- QE deals in quantities of bonds whereas YCC focuses on price of bonds
- Advantage of YCC over QE is that it can achieve lower interest rates with smaller balance sheet
- Major risk associated with YCC is that it puts credibility of central banks on the line; if inflation rises above target, Federal Reserve may have to choose between abandoning its promise or not holding its stated inflation objective
- Bank of Japan committed to YCC in 2016 to peg yields of 10-year Japanese Government Bonds around 0% in a fight to boost persistently low inflation
