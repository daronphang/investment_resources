## Efficient Market Hypothesis

- States that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible
- Stocks always trade at their fair value on exchanges, making it impossible for investors to purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks at inflated prices and hence, impossible to outperform the market through expert stock selection or market timing
- Only way to obtain higher returns is by purchasing riskier assets
- Investors could do better by investing in low-cost, passive portfolio due to market randomness
- Opponents argue that there are traders/investors that consistently generate returns that dwarf the performance of overall market and can't be blind luck; additionally there are times when excessive pessismism or optimism drives prices to trade excessively high or low and hence, showing that stocks do not always trade at fair value

## Fiat Currency

- Government-issued currency that is not backed by physical commodity but by central banks
- Value is derived from relationship between supply and demand, and the stability of issuing government
- Risk losing value due to inflation or if people lose faith in a nation's currency

## Federal Trade Commission

Organization that protects consumers and competition by preventing anticompetitive, deceptive and unfair business practices through law enforcement, advocacy, and education without unduly burdening legitmate business activities.

## FICO Score

- Credit score created by Fair Isaac Corporation
- Lenders use borrowers' FICO scores along with credit reports to assess credit risk and evaluate creditworthiness
- Takes into account data in five areas including payment history, current level of indebtedness types of credits used, length of credit history, and new credit accounts
- Score ranges from 300 to 850, with scores in 580-739 range considered to be "good" credit history

## Overweight Stock Rating

- Stock is expected to outperform its industry in the market
- Usually compared against/based on benchmark index i.e. if Apple's weighting in S&P500 is 5%, an overweight rating means it should have heavier weighting
- Opposite of 'underweight' and 'equal weight'

## Pent-up Demand

Describes a rapid increase in demand for service/product, usually following from a period of subdued spending. Consumers tend to hold off making purchases during a recession, building up a backlog of demand that is unleashed when signs of recovery emerge.

## Repricing Opportunity

- Change in market environment that allows for reassessment of value of an investment
- Can be company or sector specific, and affects both stocks and bonds
- Changes in interest rates can create repricing opportunities in banking sector as they earn income from interest
- Repricing opportunity created in retail when demand for product is much lower/higher than expected
- Oil price collapse in 2014 created repricing opportunity whereby companies with weaker balance sheets were producing to cover bills rather than driving up profits; many investors reduced their exposure to energy sector

## Secular Stagnation

- Condition where there is negligible economic growth in market-based economy over prolonged period
- Low interest rates insufficient to boost demand due to structural issues such as ageing population, lower capital investment, limited access to credit, deflationary pressures, financial crisis, and rising global inequality
- Increasing government spending on infrastructure, education, and R&D would be more prudent

## Tax Windfall

Surtax imposed by governments on businesses or economic sectors that have benefited from economic expansion or experienced above-average profits.
