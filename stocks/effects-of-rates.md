### Relationship Between Stocks and Interest Rates

- In deflationary period where there are lower expectations for growth, real yield of bond increases and hence, more attractive.
- During economic expansion, bond prices and stock market move in opposite directions as they are competing for capital; consumers make more purchases, driving up corporate earnings and leading to inflation.
- Stock market rallies as inflation is seen as bullish sign for growth and investors will move money from safety of bond market to riskier stocks due to higher risk appetite.
- Moreover, investors will sell bonds to beat inflation.

Bonds and stocks tend to move together after a recession when inflationary pressures and interest rates are low. However, they can also fall together when investors are in panic mode and sell everything. If interest rates are expected to stay low, might be prudent to buy short-term bonds to gain interest rather than waiting for higher bond yield.

### Why Bond Prices Fall When Interest Rate Rises

- Market value of bond fluctuates after purchase and moved by supply and demand.
- Investors won't be willing to pay the same amount if new bond issued offers higher interest rate.
- Shareholders tend to liquidate to avoid heavier losses.
- Fund managers may be forced to sell bonds prematurely to meet redemption requests (redemption risk).
- Holding bond to maturity won't matter as 100% of par value will be received.
