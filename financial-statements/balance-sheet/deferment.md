## Deferred Revenue (Unearned)

Payments received in advance for services which have not been performed or good not yet delivered. Classified as a liability as there is still the possibility that the good/serivce may not be delivered, or the buyer might cancel the order. Payments collected from customer would remain in Deferred Revenue until the customer has received what was due in full.

Follows GAAP as recognizing deferred revenue in Income Statement is considered aggressive accounting and effectively overstates sales revenue. Once good/service has been delivered, Revenue will be credited and Deferred Revenue will be debited.

## Valuation Allowance

A reserve that is used to offset the amount of deferred tax asset. Recorded when there is high probability of tax relief not being utilized in future due to non-availability of sufficient future taxable income.
