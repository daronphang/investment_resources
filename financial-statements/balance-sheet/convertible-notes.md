## Convertible Senior Notes

- A debt security that contains an option in which the rate will be converted into a predefined amount of issuer's shares
- Offers investors ability to earn interest but is accrued rather than paid out in cash
- Gives investors conversion discount or valuation cap (hard cap on conversion price)
- If company defaults, noteholders will be unable to get their initial seed money back

## Convertible Note Hedge

- A trading strategy used by hedge fund managers that consists of buying a convertible debt security and simultaneously shorting the conversion amount of stock
- Used to offset the actual dilution from convertible notes
- Both the number of shares shorted and acquired by converting the bond must equal
- Strategy designed to be market neutral while generating higher yield that would be obtained by holding the convertible bond alone
- If price drops, short position gains and bond price falls but investor still receives interest
- If price increases, short position loses, bond price rises and investor still receives interest
