### Bad Debt

A default risk expense that a business incurs once the repayment of credit previously extended to a customer is estimated to be uncollectible and is written off. A contingency that must be accounted for by all businesses that extend credit to customers. Payments received for bad debts that have already been written off are booked as bad debt recovery.

### Recognizing Bad Debt

1. Direct method: Records the exact amount of uncollectible accounts but fails to uphold matching principle used in GAAP which requires expenses to be matched to related revenues in same accounting period in which revenue transaction occurs.
2. Allowance method: Charge an estimated amount of accounts receivable to bad debt expense. Debit entry is made to bad debt expense and credit entry is made to allowance for doubtful accounts.
