### Bank Deposits vs Loans

Deposit is a liability for banks as depositors are paid interest or is payable on demand (during withdrawal) whereas loans are assets as banks earn interest income from them.

### Capital Structure

Combination of debt and equity used by a company to finance its overall operations and growth.

### Capital/Financial Leverage

The use of borrowed capital as a funding source when investing to expand firm's asset base and generate returns on risk capital. Strategy used to increase potential returns on an investment. Higher leverage means more debt.

### Debt Rollover

Rolling over a loan means to extend the loan's due date by paying additional fee i.e. replacing existing loan with new loan. Potentially trapped in cycle debt.

### Debenture

Type of bond or debt instrument that is unsecured by collateral and hence, must rely on creditworthiness and reputation of issuer for support. Some debentures can be converted into equity shares.

### Extinguishment of Debt

Removing a liability from Balance Sheet when bonds reach their maturity and holders are paid face value of security.

### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio

- An assessment of lending risk that financial institutions and other lenders examine before approving a mortgage.
- High LTV ratio loans are considered higher risk; loan has higher interest rate if approved.
- As time progresses, loan owed decreases while property value increases which reduces LTV.

```
LTV ratio = mortgage payment / appraised property value
```

### Stock Based Compensation

- Non-cash pay offered to employees in the form of stock options, RSU, and performance shares.
- Startup firms may lack cash or want to invest cash flow into growth initiatives, hence making equity compensation an option to attract high-quality employees.
- Expensed under COGS or operating expenses in Income Statement, and added back in Cash Flow from Operating Activities as it is classified as non-cash expense.
