## Amortization vs Depreciation

- Both methods are used to calculate value of business assets over time; focuses on spreading out loan payments
- Expense amounts used as tax deduction and reduce tax liability
- Amortization is the practice of spreading an intangible asset's cost over asset's useful life
- Depreciation is the expensing of fixed asset over its useful life
- For depreciation, the salvage/resale value is deducted from original cost, and difference is depreciated evenly over years of expected life of the asset as tangible assets have some value
