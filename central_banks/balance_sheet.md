## Balance Sheet:
- Like any business organization, central banks like Fed maintain a balance sheet showing assets and liabilities.
- Unlike ordinary banks, central bank's assets are securities purchased in open market, government securities, and loans made to financial institutions.
- When Fed buys a security, it pays by crediting the reserve account of member banks through an accounting entry.
- When member wishes to convert their reserve balances into cash, Fed provides them dollar bills.
- Liabilities include US currency in circulation and money held in reserve accounts of member banks.
- Requires commerical banks to hold minimum of 10% deposit amount as reserves.
- Reserves are assets for commerical banks but liabilities for central banks.
