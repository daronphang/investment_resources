## Fiscal Policy

- Addresses taxation and government spending and is generally determined by government legislation
- Most widely used means are changes in government spending policies or government tax policies
- Governments can spend more money (stimulus spending) if there is not enough business activity in economy
- If there is not enough tax receipts to pay for spending, governments borrow money by issuing debt securities such as government bonds and in the process, accumulate debt (deficit spending)
- Deficit spending occurs when government spends more money annually than it takes in
- Foreign investors and countries are parties responsible for buying issued Treasury securities
- By increasing taxes, government pull money out of economy and slow business activity
- Targets specific communities, industries, investments, or commodities to either favor or discourage production
- However, policies may be politically motivated

## Monetary Policy

- Addressses interest rates and total supply of money in circulation that is generally carried out by central banks
- Aims to spur economic activity by incentivizing businesses/consumers to borrow and spend
- Can also act as brake on inflation and other issues associated with an overheated economy

## Fiscal vs Monetary Policy

- Both are macroeconomic tools used to manage or stimulate the economy
- Fiscal addresses tax and government spending while monetary addresses interest rates and money supply
- Fiscal is set by government while monetary is set by central banks
- Monetary is largely independent of political motivations and faster to implement
