## Overview:
- Follows labor market's employment capacity and analyzes unemployment along with wage growth in correlation with inflation.
- Has ability to effectively influence interest rates on credit which has direct effect on business and consumer spending.
- Established three-part mandate which involves maximizing employment, stablizing prices, and monitoring interest rates.
- Mostly targeted 2% inflation rate as a guide for price movement.

## Tactics:
1) Open market operations.
2) Setting federal discount and funds rate.
3) Specifying reserve requirements for banks.

## Open Market Operations (OMOs):
- Central bank creates money and buy short-term Treasury securities from banks, individuals and institutions in open market.
- Higher demand for securities lowers federal funds rate and injects money into the bank system which is then loaned to businesses/individuals.

## Quantitative Easing (QE):
- Unconventional monetary policy whereby Fed purchases longer-term market/government securities (public and private) to lower interest rates and quickly increase domestic money supply.
- Objective is to spur economic activity, lower unemployment and keep credit flowing.
- Significantly increases central bank's balance sheet.
- Lower interest rates and increased money supply in reserves incentivised banks to loosen their lending standards.
- Typically implemented when interest rates are nearly zero as they have fewer tools to influence economic growth.
- Involves large-scale purchases of financial assets.
- If QE loses effectiveness, can be combined with fiscal policy to further expand money supply.
- Originated from Bank of Japan in 2001 following Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 but failed to meet its inflation goals.

### How QE Works (Federal Reserve):
1) Fed creates money out of thin air by creating bank reserves on its balance sheet.
2) Reserves are used to purchase long-term Treasuries in open market from major financial institutions.
3) Financial institutions have more cash in their reserve accounts which they can hold, lend out to consumers and businesses, or buy other assets.
4) Liquidity in financial system increases (more currency in circulation) which prevents credit crunch.
5) Higher demand for fixed-income assets will cause prices to rise and interest rates to fall.
6) Lower rates make it cheaper to borrow money and encourages businesses/consumers to take loans.
7) Asset allocations are changed as investors are more inclined to take bigger risks in stock market.
8) Confidence in economy is restored as market is "hedged" or safeguarded by Fed.

### Downsides:
- Risk of devaluating domestic currency and potentially causing rampant inflation.
- Stabilizes asset prices in short-term but simultaneously generates long-term political instability due to distortions created by allowing any marginal value-additive practices to persist i.e. creates zombie companies whereby they are generating marginal returns to stay profitable.
- Create asset bubbles and widen wealth inequality.
- Society being taken into an unhealthy trajectory and makes greater distortions between prices and intrinsic value.
- Businesses may over-indulge in debt binge as they see Fed as backstopper. 
- Dangerous if Fed is primary turner for economy as policy is artificial and not organic. 

## OMO vs QE:
- OMO is a tool used to influence rate changes in debt market across specified securities and maturities.
- QE is a holistic strategy triggered during crisis that seeks to lower borrowing rates to help stimulate economic growth.
