## Overview:
- Follows labor market's employment capacity and analyzes unemployment along with wage growth in correlation with inflation.
- Has ability to effectively influence interest rates on credit which has direct effect on business and consumer spending.
- Established three-part mandate which involves maximizing employment, stablizing prices, and monitoring interest rates.
- Mostly targeted 2% inflation rate as a guide for price movement.

## Tactics:
1) Open market operations.
2) Setting federal funds rate.
3) Specifying reserve requirements for banks.

## Open Market Operations (OMOs):
- Central bank creates money and buy short-term Treasury securities from banks, individuals and institutions in open market.
- Demand for securities injects money into the bank system which is then loaned to businesses/individuals.

## Quantitative Easing (QE):
- Unconventional monetary policy whereby Fed purchases longer-term market/government securities (public/private) to lower interest rates and quickly increase domestic money supply to spur economic activity and keep credit flowing.
- Significantly increases central bank's balance sheet.
- Lower interest rates and increased money supply in reserves incentivised banks to loosen their lending standards.
- Typically implemented when interest rates are nearly zero as they have fewer tools to influence economic growth.
- Involves large-scale purchases of financial assets.
- If QE loses effectiveness, can be combined with fiscal policy to further expand money supply.
- Originated from Bank of Japan in 2001 following Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 but failed to meet its inflation goals.
- Risk of devaluating domestic currency.

## OMO vs QE:
- OMO is a tool used to influence rate changes in debt market across specified securities and maturities.
- QE is a holistic strategy triggered during crisis that seeks to lower borrowing rates to help stimulate economic growth.
