## Deferred Tax Asset:
- Item that may be used to reduce taxable income in future
- Happens when business overpaid taxes or paid in advance on its balance sheet due to authorities recognizing different timing for expenses and revenue.
- Returned as tax relief with expiration date.
- Need to access the recoverability of assets which requires company to generate sufficient future taxable income to use the whole benefit.
- Valuation allowance established if unable to be supported by carryback ability i.e. amount that cannot be recovered.

## Goodwill:
- An indefinite intangible asset associated with the cost of purchasing another business (merger/acquisition) including brand reputation, solid customer base, customer loyalty, patents, good employee relations, and proprietary technology.
- Refers to the premium paid over fair value of assets.
- Cannot be bought or sold. Does not amortize or depreciate as a normal asset would.
- Subjected to impairment and is tested annually or whenever a triggering event causes the fair market value of goodwill asset to drop below the carrying value.

High goodwill to asset ratio means the company cannot be easily liquidated for monetary gain, and valuation of company can swing if writedowns/impairments are performed. High goodwill may also signal overpayment, reckless spending, and damaging writedowns in future which lead to future asset-level instability. ROIC may be lowered if synergies don't work out as expected.

## Goodwill Impairment:
An accounting charge that companies record when the goodwill's carrying value (recorded at time of acquisition/merger) exceeded its fair value. Arises when there is deterioration in capabilities of acquired assets to generate cash flows.

## Valuation Allowance:
A reserve that is used to offset the amount of deferred tax asset. Recorded when there is high probability of tax relief not being utilized in future due to non-availability of sufficient future taxable income.
