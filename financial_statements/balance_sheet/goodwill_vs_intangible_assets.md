## Goodwill:
- An indefinite intangible asset associated with the cost of purchasing another business (merger/acquisition) including brand reputation, solid customer base, customer loyalty, patents, good employee relations, and proprietary technology.
- Refers to the premium paid over fair value of assets.
- Cannot be bought or sold. Does not amortize or depreciate as a normal asset would.
- Subjected to impairment and is tested annually or whenever a triggering event causes the fair market value of goodwill asset to drop below the carrying value.

High goodwill to asset ratio means the company cannot be easily liquidated for monetary gain, and valuation of company can swing if writedowns/impairments are performed. High goodwill may also signal overpayment, reckless spending, and damaging writedowns in future which lead to future asset-level instability. ROIC may be lowered if synergies don't work out as expected.

## Goodwill Impairment:
An accounting charge that companies record when the goodwill's carrying value (recorded at time of acquisition/merger) exceeded its fair value. Arises when there is deterioration in capabilities of acquired assets to generate cash flows. 

## Intangible Assets:
Assets that can be sold/purchased independently i.e. licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc. Have a definite life as compared to goodwill.
