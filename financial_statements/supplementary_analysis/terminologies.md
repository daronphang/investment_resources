## Bank Deposits vs Loans:
Deposit is a liability for banks as depositors are paid interest or is payable on demand (during withdrawal) whereas loans are assets as banks earn interest income from them.

## Bad Debt:
A default risk expense that a business incurs once the repayment of credit previously extended to a customer is estimated to be uncollectible and is written off. A contingency that must be accounted for by all businesses that extend credit to customers. Payments received for bad debts that have already been written off are booked as bad debt recovery.

### Recognizing Bad Debt:
1) Direct method: Records the exact amount of uncollectible accounts but fails to uphold matching principle used in GAAP which requires expenses to be matched to related revenues in same accounting period in which revenue transaction occurs.
2) Allowance method: Charge an estimated amount of accounts receivable to bad debt expense. Debit entry is made to bad debt expense and credit entry is made to allowance for doubtful accounts. 

## Capital/Financial Leverage:
The use of borrowed capital as a funding source when investing to expand firm's asset base and generate returns on risk capital. Strategy used to increase potential returns on an investment. Higher leverage means more debt.

## Extinguishment of Debt:
Removing a liability from Balance Sheet when bonds reach their maturity and holders are paid face value of security.
