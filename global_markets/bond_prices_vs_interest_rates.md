## Why Bond Prices Fall When Interest Rate Rises:
- Market value of bond fluctuates after purchase and moved by supply and demand.
- Investors won't be willing to pay the same amount if new bond issued offers higher interest rate.
- Shareholders tend to liquidate to avoid heavier losses.
- Fund managers may be forced to sell bonds prematurely to meet redemption requests (redemption risk).
- Holding bond to maturity won't matter as 100% of par value will be received.
