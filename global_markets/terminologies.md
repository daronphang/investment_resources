## Federal Trade Commission:
Organization that protects consumers and competition by preventing anticompetitive, deceptive and unfair business practices through law enforcement, advocacy, and education without unduly burdening legitmate business activities.

## Pent-up Demand:
Describes a rapid increase in demand for service/product, usually following from a period of subdued spending. Consumers tend to hold off making purchases during a recession, building up a backlog of demand that is unleashed when signs of recovery emerge.

## Repricing Opportunity:
- Change in market environment that allows for reassessment of value of an investment.
- Can be company or sector specific, and affects both stocks and bonds.
- Changes in interest rates can create repricing opportunities in banking sector as they earn income from interest.
- Repricing opportunity created in retail when demand for product is much lower/higher than expected.
- Oil price collapse in 2014 created repricing opportunity whereby companies with weaker balance sheets were producing to cover bills rather than driving up profits; many investors reduced their exposure to energy sector. 

## Secular Stagnation:
- Condition where there is negligible economic growth in market-based economy over prolonged period.
- Low interest rates insufficient to boost demand due to structural issues such as ageing population, lower capital investment, limited access to credit, deflationary pressures, financial crisis, and rising global inequality.
- Increasing government spending on infrastructure, education, and R&D would be more prudent.
