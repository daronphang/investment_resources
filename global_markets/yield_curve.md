## Yield Curve:
- Yield curve plots interest rates of bonds of equal credit and different maturities.
- Provides an indication of where short-term interest rates and economic growth are headed into the future.
- Three types include normal, inverted and flat.
- Normal curves point to economic expansion, inverted points to economic recession.

## Yield Curve Risk:
- Risk that a change in interest rates will impact fixed-income securities and is associated with flattening/steepening of curve.
- Flattening is defined as narrowing of yield spread between short-term and long-term rates (interest rates converging).
- Steepening refers to widening of spread i.e. yields on long-term bonds rising faster than short-term bonds.
