### Treasury Yields

- Seen as safe-haven investment (fixed-income product).
- Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
- When economy is healthy, investors are more open to buying riskier assets and hence, causing bond prices to fall and yields to rise (stocks mirror yields movement).

### Direct Economic Factors

1. Interest Rates: When Fed lowers fund rate, creates additional demand for treasuries as previous investors can lock in money at higher rate issued previously.
2. Inflation: When inflationary pressures emerge, yields move higher to compensate for diminishing purchasing power in future.
3. Economic Growth: Strong growth leads to increased inflation and competition over time and hence, yields must move higher.
