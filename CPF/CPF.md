## CPF Accounts

### OA

Eligible to use CPF savings to buy a new/resale HDB flat.

### RA

SA and OA savings combine to form FRS of up to $192,000 at age 55. The BRS (Basic Retirement Sum) is $90,500. Can top up RA up to Enhanced Retirement Sum of $271,500 (3 times BRS). Retirement Sum will then be used to join CPF LIFE from age 65, which provides monthly payout from payout eligibility age of 65 (can defer till 70).

### PSEA

Unused amount will be transferred to CPF OA at age 31.

## Contributions

Salaries are broken down into Ordinary Wages and Additional Wages, and both attract CPF contributions.

### OW

OW is capped at $6,000 per month (first $6,000 requires CPF contributions from employee and employer). Maximum contributions from both employee (20%) and employer (17%) is $26,640 per annum i.e. 37% of $6,000 \* 12 months.

### AW

AW ceiling is calculated on a per annum basis (amount that attracts CPF contributions is $102,000 - total OW). Similar contribution rates apply for AW.

### VC

VC can be made to all three accounts or to MediSave. Making top-ups help to build CPF savings for your retirement, housing and healthcare needs. When making VC to all three accounts, no tax relief is provided.

The maximum amount you can topup is the difference between CPF annual limit of $37,740 and mandatory CPF contributions (OW + AW). Any excess top-ups will be refunded without interest. Allowable voluntary contribution excluding AW is $11,100 per annum.
Top-ups

Making cash top-ups or CPF transfers to SA from OA can help grow your retirement savings. Can enjoy tax relief of up to $16,000 per calendar year ($8,000 for yourself, and $8,000 for loved ones). Transfer of funds from OA to SA does not qualify for tax relief.

You can top up to reach the current FRS (Full Retirement Sum) of $192,000.

## CPF LIFE

An insurance and not an investment product. You will be automatically included if you have at least $60,000 in RA. Can choose to opt out if you have a pension or private annuity plan that pays the same or higher monthly payouts than CPF LIFE.

Payout depends on the CPF RA balance and CPF LIFE plan you choose. All three plans will provide monthly payouts no matter how long you live.

### Escalating Plan

Payouts increase by 2% YoY to help keep your lifestyle even as inflation rises.

### Standard Plan

Fixed budget but requires to lower your lifestyle to buy less things.

### Basic Plan
